\description{
  GUI version of \code{\link{mkinmod}}. The function takes
  a specification, consisting of a list of the compartments
  in the data. Each compartment is again represented by a
  list, specifying the kinetic model type, reaction or
  transfer to other observed compartments, the initial
  parameter values, lower and upper bounds, fixed or not,
  and observed data.

  \code{mkinmod} is a deprecated version doing the same for
  the use with \code{mkinfit.gui},\code{IRLSkinfit.gui} and
  \code{mcmckinfit.gui}.
